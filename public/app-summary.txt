1. Core Functionality

The app is running with Node.js + Express backend and modern frontend.

NewsAPI integration provides initial article data for categories:

News

Sports

Entertainment

Technology

Users can click a category button to load 5 latest articles per section.

Each article card includes:

Optional image

Title with link

Initial NewsAPI summary

“Read full article” link

Source badge and published date

2. AI Summarization

AI summaries (4–5 sentences) are fetched asynchronously for each article.

While AI summary is loading:

A spinner appears inside the card.

Once AI summary arrives, it replaces the initial NewsAPI description and spinner disappears.

If API rate limits are reached:

NewsAPI summaries still display immediately.

AI summaries will populate when quota refreshes.

3. UI / UX Enhancements

Modern card design with rounded corners, shadows, and hover effects.

Soft blue button color for readability.

Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

Dark/light mode toggle:

Floating sun/moon icon at the top-right.

Applies site-wide, saved in localStorage.

Optional images display above summaries.

Smooth transitions between light and dark themes.

4. Translation (planned)

We discussed adding a language dropdown for English, French, Spanish, Swahili, Arabic, Mandarin, Cantonese.

Currently not active, but architecture allows:

Summarization in a selected language

Translation of existing summaries

Caching per language to maintain speed

5. Remaining Enhancements

Fully integrate AI summary translations if desired.

Add optional subtle animations for spinner fade-in/fade-out.

Improve marketable polish, e.g., favicon, logo, hover effects for cards/images.

Possibly pre-fetch summaries for smoother experience.

✅ Current state:

Functional, modern, marketable news summarizer app.

Users can select categories, read summaries, click full articles.

Dark/light mode works globally.

AI summaries load asynchronously with spinner.

If you want, the next step could be adding translation and caching or polishing UI/animations for a fully market-ready product.

Do you want me to focus on translation next or UI polish/animations?
